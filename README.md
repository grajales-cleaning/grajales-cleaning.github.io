## Deployment

This project is configured for deployment to GitHub Pages using the `gh-pages` package.

### Prerequisites for Deployment

1. **GitHub CLI Authentication** (recommended):
   ```bash
   # Install GitHub CLI if not already installed
   # macOS: brew install gh
   # Windows: Download from https://cli.github.com/
   
   # Authenticate with GitHub
   gh auth login
   ```

2. **Alternative: SSH/Personal Access Token**:
   - Ensure your local Git is configured with SSH keys or a personal access token
   - GitHub repository must have Pages enabled

### Deployment Process

The deployment uses a two-branch approach:
- **`main` branch**: Contains your source code
- **`gh-pages` branch**: Contains the built static files (auto-created)

### Manual Deployment

From the main branch, run:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This command will:
1. Run `npm run build` to create the production build
2. Deploy the `dist/` folder contents to the `gh-pages` branch
3. Push to GitHub, triggering the Pages deployment

### GitHub Pages Configuration

1. Go to your repository settings on GitHub
2. Navigate to **Pages** section
3. Set source to "Deploy from a branch"
4. Select `gh-pages` branch and `/ (root)` folder
5. Your site will be available at: `https://[username].github.io/[repository-name]`

### Deployment Notes

- The site uses HashRouter for client-side routing compatibility with GitHub Pages
- The `public/CNAME` file configures custom domain (if applicable)
- Changes to the main branch can be deployed anytime with `npm run deploy`
- First-time setup may take a few minutes for GitHub Pages to activate

### Troubleshooting Deployment

- Ensure you have push permissions to the repository
- Check that GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings
- Verify authentication: `gh auth status`
- For permission issues, ensure your GitHub account has access to the repository
